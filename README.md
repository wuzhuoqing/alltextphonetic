# alltextphonetic
The MS word has the Phonetic Guide dialog which can be used to add pinyin above chinese chars. However the default guide dialog only add pinyin to a few of the words instead of all text. We can instead use a macro to help with it.

The initial code is from [this stackoverflow] (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34602598/how-to-add-phonetic-guides-to-all-the-texts-at-once) and improved with batch for speed. The generated pinyin default alignment may not be what you want, You can use the field code search replace trick to change the formatting. (I learn the trick from another place but I lost the source link).
